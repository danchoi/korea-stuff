  Regent Hungson Taewongun 1820-98. de facto King of Choson, led Korea
  into one of its most critical stages of history from 1864-1874.  "To
  not fight against the invading Western barbarians and instead
  negotiate for peace is to sell the country" (He set up these steeles.)

  Catholic converts increase to 23,000. 8,000 Korea converts and 9
  French missionaries are executed. The French retaliate against Korea.
  1866, French fleet of 7 warships under Admiral Roze invades Kanghwa
  Island. French forces land and efeat the Korean garrison and sack the
  town. They demand the punishment of those who had executed the
  missionaries. Loot is collected in Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris.

  When Japan in 1874 tries to break Choson from {{{the traditional East
  Asian world order}}} korea wants to demonstrate the superiority of the
  Confucian state. Japan sent a letter to the Choson court demanding
  trade.  Sends letter in accordance with new diplomatic protocol, not
  traditional kyorin format. 

  "To the Korean people of this time, who had no idea or perspective on
  the world's capitalistic modernization, the collapse of the East-Asian
  world order meant a crisis of security. Thus, they could not accept
  this letter which went beyond traditional diplomacy."


  Pak Kyusu and his studnets were enlightened by their experiences
  overseas in Japan. They should to reform institutions into a modern

  legitimacy. Neo-Confucian court executes Cho Cheu in 1864.

  Reform-minded officials some from the Kapsin group, take power thanks
  to Japanese military support after Sino-Japanese War. Implement

  this series of modernization reform measures form 1894-1896 the Kabo

  calendar in starting in 1896. Same day, King decrees that all Korean
  males cut off their traditional topknots.

  King flies to Russian legation and negates Kabo political reforms.

  1896. Japanese suggest to Russia dividing Korea along 38th parallel in
  event that Japanese and Russian troops were to occupy the peninsula.
  Americans would later unwittingly agree to a version of this concept
