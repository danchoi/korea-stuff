The Cleanest Race 
B.R. Myers

p. 45

  Kim saw no actual need to create an actual idoelogy to back up the
  cant, but one of his advisors, a self-styled philosopher named Hwang
  Chang-yop, finally persuaded the leaders to entrust him with this
  task. Hwang had his work cut out for him, because there was nothing in
  in Kim's talk of self-reliance, or of adapting Marxism-Leninism to
  national conditions, that Mao had not only said more eloquently, but
  had done a much ebtter job of putting into practice as well. 

  ... tried not to distract the domestic masses from the de facto
  ideology of race-based nationalism (which of course could not be
  conveyed to the outside world). He had to come up with something
  innocuous, impenetrable, yet imposing, and in the end he did just
  that. 

  true ruling ideology is not juche but paranoid nationalism.

p. 47

  Though Juche Thought is enshrined in the constitution as one of the
  country's guiding principles, the regime has never shown any
  indiciation of subscribing to its universalist-humanist bromides.

  [Juche] decoys outsiders away from the true dominant ideology. Instead
  of an implacably xenophobic, race-based worldview rerived largely form
  fascist Japanese myth, the world sees a reassuringly dull
  state-nationalism conceived by post-colonial Koreans, rooted in
  humanist principles, and evincing an understandable if unfortunate
  preccupation with autonomy and self-reliance.

criticize Bruce Cumings

p. 48

  The historian Bruce Cumings, in apologetic desperation, concludes that
  [Juche] is "inaccessible to the non-Korean." As if North Koreans were
  not as baffled by it as everyone else! The regime's decision not to
  publish a comprehensive Juche treatise under Kim Il Sung's name turns
  out to have been a stroke of genius. 

parent leader: oboi suryong, and like Hriohito Kim Il Sung was more a
mother figure than a patriarch. Worker's Party calls itself the Mother
Party. Thus is not like Confucianism, which dictactes that a mother must
obey even her own sons.

p. 50 

  1987 Soviet aid drops. Raise world market prices for Soviet goods.
  1990s. "Let's Eat Two Meals a Day" slogan.

1994 82 year old Parent Leader passes away

Famine of 1995-1997 appeared to offer retroactive proof that the Parent
Leader had been single-handedly feeding and clothing his people up to
his death.

1994 ration crisis - "military first" government is a diversion from it.
Awkward because relations with US was great -- Clinton groveled, send
energy aid to NK. Toned down invective in English language service, but
domestic propaganda called Agreed Frameworked an abject Yankee
surrender. Dear Leader busy visiting military bases, so provinces have
to take self-reliance to next level and feeed themselves. 

p. 53 

  Soldiers roamed the countryside in search of food, robbing
  civilians... Refugees have provided credible testimony of widespread
  cannibalism. Foreign experts now estimate that about a million people
  -- roughtly 5 percent of the population -- died from hunger-related
  causes during the worst period of the famine, from 1995 to 1997.

p. 55 


support for the regime was not undermined. mid-1990s 

  North Koreans had ceased paying even lip service to Marxism-Leninism.
  Socliasm .. had come to mean only "how we do things," capitalism a
  catchword for "how Yankees enslave the southern brethren." It was
  because the regime no longer derived its legitimacy from a commitment
  to improve material conditions that it did not have to deny there was
  an economic crisis, something the Soviet and Chinese parties had
  destroyed their own credibility by doing.

p. 55

  The Sunshine policy put Kim Jong Il in a difficult position. He could
  hardly admit that the ROK wanted friendlier relations, because this
  would mean it was no Yankee puppet after all. Neither could he
  endanger the flow of aid by continuing to vilify his counterpart in
  Seoul as if nothing had happened. So it was that the official news
  agency ceased its attacks on the South Korean government, and less
  prominent propaganda outlets picked up the slack.

p. 57

  south'South Korean videos and DVD's did a roaring trade in rural
  markets

  the South's prosperity quickly became common knowledge inside the
  DPRK. Realizing it would do no good to deny it, the propaganda
  apparatus in 2000 began openly admitting that South Koreans enjoy a
  higher stand of living. This prosperity was rather ingeniously
  attributed to the Dear Leader's "military first" policy, which had
  allegedly kept the Yankees from unleashing another ruinous war on the
  peninsula. 


p. 57 Korean racism
 
  Koreans in both republics generally agree that they are a uniquely
  homogenous, i.e. pure-blooded people whose innate goodness has made
  them perennial victims of foreign powers.

  [Really? S Koreans complain a lot about modern S Korean shallowness.
  They are cynical about other S Koreans.]

p. 58 

  Although South Koreans are glad that they compromised their
  nationalist principles for wealth and modernity, many of them feel a
  nagging sense of moral inferiority to their more orthodox brethren.
  They may disapprove of the North's actions, but rarely with
  indignation, often blaming America or Japan for having provoked them. 

  [A questionable point by Myers]

p. 60

  In short, the spread of capitalism did not appear to be eroding
  support for the regime. "Making money is patriotic" was said to be a
  popular if informal slogan.


p. 61 Kim Jong Il appears to have been caught off guard by the S Korean
election results in November 2007. It was awkward to concede the truth
that the South Koreans had chosen a pro-Yankee candidate; 

  "this would mean either that the Korean race was not so pure after
  all, or, even more unthinkably, that there was something in Dear
  Leader that had alienated them."

p. 62

  NK propaganda hoped to say Lee Myung Bak had hoodwinked the S Korean
  electorate by keeping his tru political intentions secret... hoping
  the masses would not remember its criticism of Lee's campaign
  platform! But luck was on Kim Jong Il's side.


p. 63 

  Kumgang tourist resort and Kaesong Industrial Zone (both just north of
  DMZ) -- two N-S cooperation projects embarked on during the Sunshine
  Policy era.



  2008 Lee Myung Bak stumble over American beef imports. 

p. 63

  2008 Sept 9, Kim Jong Il fails to appear in public at military parade
  celebrating NK's 60th anniversary. Kim had suffered a stroke in
  August. Pictures of him after. The propaganda apparatus had evidently
  concluded that offering visual evidence of a stroke was better than
  letting the world run riot with rumors of an even more subversive
  nature .... but the decision cannot have been an easy one (Physical
  infirmity always carries a greater stigma IN STATES THAT ESPOUSE A
  RACE THEORY).

p. 64

  Kim Jong Un, the second son of Ko Yonghui, the third wife or second
  mistress. Rumored to have studied in Switzerland and gained an
  expertise in COMPUTERIZED PRODUCTION 


  ??? Meanwhile, however, the North Korean print media stuck to the its
  longstanding policy of acting as if the Dear Leader had no wife or
  offsping at all. [Why?]
