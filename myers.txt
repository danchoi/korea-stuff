The Cleanest Race

  Kim saw no actual need to create an actual idoelogy to back up the
  cant, but one of his advisors, a self-styled philosopher named Hwang
  Chang-yop, finally persuaded the leaders to entrust him with this
  task. Hwang had his work cut out for him, because there was nothing in
  in Kim's talk of self-reliance, or of adapting Marxism-Leninism to
  national conditions, that Mao had not only said more eloquently, but
  had done a much ebtter job of putting into practice as well. 

  ... tried not to distract the domestic masses from the de facto
  ideology of race-based nationalism (which of course could not be
  conveyed to the outside world). He had to come up with something
  innocuous, impenetrable, yet imposing, and in the end he did just
  that. 

  true ruling ideology is not juche but paranoid nationalism.

  Though Juche Thought is enshrined in the constitution as one of the
  country's guiding principles, the regime has never shown any
  indiciation of subscribing to its universalist-humanist bromides.
